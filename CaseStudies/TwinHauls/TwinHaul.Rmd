## Summary

**This case study demonstrates:**

-   Estimating logistic and Richards selection curves from twin-haul data. 
-   Fitting to catch-share curves.
-   Using combined individual-haul data to estimate over-dispersion (due to
    causes such as sub-sampling, between-haul variability and non-independent
    behaviour of fish).
-   Using the bootstrap and over-dispersion adjustments.

### Data source

The data are for Eastern king prawn selectivity in a 20 mm square-mesh penaeid trawl (Broadhurst et al., 2004. Selectivity of conventional diamond- and novel square-mesh
codends in an Australian estuarine penaeid-trawl fishery. Fisheries Research, 67: 183-194). 

```{r, echo=F}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.height = 3.5)
knitr::include_graphics("TwinTrawl.jpg")
```

```{r, warning=F, message=F, echo=-1}
#devtools::install( paste0("T:/Russell_SSD/ACTIVE/CurrentWork/RPackages/SELECT") )
require(SELECT)
require(dplyr)
```

### Input the data
```{r}
#Read in data and remove zero catch lengths
sqKP.df=read.csv("../Data/SqNorKP.csv",header=T) #500 by 4
sqKP.df=subset(sqKP.df,control+codend>0) #192 by 4
#Quick peek at data
head(sqKP.df)
```


### Define variable names
```{r}
v.names=c("lgth","control","codend")
```

### Produce plot of catch-share proportions
```{r}
Tots=Raw2Tots(sqKP.df,v.names)
Tots=transform(Tots,n=codend+control,y=codend/(codend+control)) 
Tots
plot(y~lgth,data=Tots,las=1)
abline(h=0.5,lty=3)
```

### Fit logistic selection curve
```{r}
Logist.fit=SELECT(Tots,var.names=v.names,dtype="ec")
plot(Logist.fit)
ModelCheck(Logist.fit)
Estimates(Logist.fit)
```
The logistic fit looks good.


### Fit Richards curve
```{r}
Rich.fit=SELECT(Tots,var.names=v.names,dtype="ec",stype="richards")
plot(Rich.fit)
ModelCheck(Rich.fit)
Estimates(Rich.fit)
```

Even without correcting for possible over-dispersion it is clear that the 
extra complexity of the Richard curve is not needed.
The logistic is good enough.

## Correcting for over-dispersion

### Produce a lattic plot of catch-share proportions by haul

```{r, fig.height=5}
HaulCatch=Raw2Tots(sqKP.df,v.names,sumHauls=F)
HaulCatch=transform(HaulCatch,n=codend+control,y=codend/(codend+control)) 
require(lattice) #For xyplot
xyplot(y~lgth | PairID,data=HaulCatch)
```

The retention proportions are certainly highly variable, but it is hard to
distinguish BHV from within-haul variability.

### Fit a logistic selection curve to the combined individual pair data

```{r}
Logist.fit2=SELECT(sqKP.df,var.names=v.names,dtype="ec",sumHauls=F)
ModelCheck(Logist.fit2, minE=5, plots=F)
```

The variance correction factor `Pearson.CF` shows that the actual variabilty is
about twice that assumed under the binomial model.
This is relatively low, and a bootstrap would probably over-estimate the
standard errors.

In this case it is preferable to do a simple over-dispersion adjustment to the
raw standard errors.

```{r}
Estimates(Logist.fit,OD=2.08)
```
