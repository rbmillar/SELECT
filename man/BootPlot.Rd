\usage{
BootPlot(
  BootPreds,
  lenseq,
  predn,
  Data = NULL,
  eps = 0.025,
  txt = 8,
  xlab = "Length (cm)",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{BootPreds}{Matrix with bootstraps by row and fitted values at length in columns, as produced by bootSELECT.}

\item{predn}{Fitted curve}

\item{eps}{The quantiles for the lower and upper bootstrap confidence limits are \code{eps} and 1-\code{eps}. Default is 95\% intervals.}

\item{txt}{Size of text used in the plot axes.}

\item{lenseqs}{Lengths at which fitted values were calculated.}

\item{If}{provided the data are added to the plot. The length variable must have the name \code{lgth} and the catch proportion variable \code{y}.}

\value{
ggplot GROB
}
\description{
Uses ggplot to produce a grob (graphical object) displaying the fitted curve and pointwise bootstrap confidence intervals.
